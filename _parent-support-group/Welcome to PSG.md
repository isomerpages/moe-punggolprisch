<p>Dear Fellow PPS Parents,</p>
<p>Welcome to Punggol Primary School’s Parent Support Group website!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Parents are children’s first teachers. Our influence, support, engagement and involvement in our children’s learning play a pivotal role in influencing their education and holistic growth. Research has proven that family’s involvement from the primary level can help the process of learning becomes easier and comfortable for our young children and help influence our children’s attitude too. This attitude tends to incline towards good and positive things, like friendships, developing and having positive work ethics, superior moral values and empathy towards others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Therefore, in PPS, all parents by default belong to Parent Support Group. We have a dedicated PPS PSG coordinator who connects and updates upcoming school’s activities which requires parents’ involvement. With the major easing of Covid-19 rules, all of us are happy to be physically back in PPS to volunteer our services.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A sincere ‘Thank You’ to everyone who have volunteered selflessly, still volunteering and planning to volunteer. I hope not just the children but all of you do benefit from being a PSG.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Ending off with a heartwarming quote from Jane D. Hull, <center><em>“At the end of the day, the most overwhelming key to a child’s success<br>is the positive involvement of parents.”</em></center></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Let’s all enjoy our wonderful parenting and volunteering in 2023!</p>
