**P1-P3 Unstructured Recess Play (URP)**&nbsp;

  

<center>"In our schools, I think we can free up some&nbsp;space to embrace some messiness and<br>uncertainty of outcomes, as perfect structure&nbsp;and instructions can impede innovation. We can<br>afford this space to let our childrenâ€™s&nbsp;imagination grow, because imagination is the wellspring<br>of ideas in their mental playground&nbsp;and will serve them richly for their journey through life."<br><br>Mr Ng Chee Meng, Minister of Education<br>(Schools)</center>
