### Department Goal

##### Inspire, Inquire, Innovate

The Science learning experiences in PPS seek to achieve the following in our students.

(a) **<u>Inspired by Science.</u>** Students enjoy learning Science and are fascinated by how everyday phenomena have scientific connections and how Science helps solve many of our global challenges. They regard Science as relevant and meaningful, appreciating how Science and Technology have transformed the world, and improved our lives. Students are open to the possibility of pursuing Science-related careers as a viable profession to serve the good of society

(b) **<u>Inquire like Scientists.</u>** Students have strong fundamentals in Science and possess the spirit of scientific inquiry. They are able to engage confidently in the Practices of Science, grounded in the knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played by Science in daily life, society and the environment. They can discern, weigh alternatives, and evaluate claims and ideas critically, based on logical scientific evidence and arguments, and yet be able to suspend judgement where there is lack of evidence

(c) **<u>Innovate using Science.</u>** Students apply Science to generate creative solutions to solve real-world problems, ranging from those affecting everyday lives to complex problems affecting humanity. It is envisaged that there will be a strong pipeline of students who can contribute towards STEM research, innovation, and enterprise.
