<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:16px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.8">The teaching of values, knowledge and skills are taught in the Mother Language Languages (MTL) in primary school. For students who are offered the Non-Tamil Indian Languages and for those who are exempted from MTL, CCE lessons are taught in English. To cater to these students, instructional materials are provided in English.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:16px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.8">Designed with studentsâ€™ daily experiences as context, CCE lessons help students to better relate to them and make learning more meaningful and relevant. Students are also engaged in collaborative activities and projects to learn values through three overarching ideas - Identity, Relationships and Choices in six domains, starting with self and extending to the family, school, community, nation and the world.</p>
