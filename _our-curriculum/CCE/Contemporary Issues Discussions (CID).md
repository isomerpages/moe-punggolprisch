<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:16px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.8">In order to ensure that we have a shared and lively narrative in a multi-dimensional Singapore Story, PPS has carved out time to allow for student voices and experiences to be heard through discussions of Singaporeâ€™s contemporary realities through issues. This is done through Relational Circles with both the form and co-form teachers engaging our students in conversations.</p>
