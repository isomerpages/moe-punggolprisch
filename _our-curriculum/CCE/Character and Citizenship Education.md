##### Our Approach

The CCE Department aims to develop our Punggolites to be students of good character, have a balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships and be resilient when faced with challenges. Our students will be future-ready and be active citizens.   

  

<u><i>CCE Lessons</i></u>

These lessons provide the time for teachers to engage and build relationships with their students through discussions and effective classroom strategies.

  

<u><i>Student Development Experiences</i></u>

Student Development Experiences (SDEs) are programmes and activities that contribute towards the holistic development of our students in the physical, aesthetic, intellectual, moral, and social domains. 

  

<u><i>School-based Initiatives</i></u>

Every school context is different, and the needs, interests, and abilities of students vary within each context. Punggol Primary Schools designs and implement programmes and activities for CCE that cater to our Punggolites. 

  

We start the year off with our #becomingaSTAR Orientation Programme and engage our students through purposeful reflection in MY PPS STORY Reflection Journal.
