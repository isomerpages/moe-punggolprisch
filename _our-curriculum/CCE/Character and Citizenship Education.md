<div style="font-family:Arial; font-size:16px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.8">The CCE Department aims to develop our Punggolites to be students of good character, have a balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships and be resilient when faced with challenges. Our students will be future-ready and be active citizens.</div>

Student Development Experiences (SDEs) are programmes and activities that contribute towards the holistic development of our students in the physical, aesthetic, intellectual, moral, and social domains.<br></li>

Every school context is different, and the needs, interests, and abilities of students vary within each context. Punggol Primary Schools designs and implement programmes and activities for CCE that cater to our Punggolites.&nbsp;<br><br>We start the year off with our #becomingaSTAR Orientation Programme and engage our students through purposeful reflection in MY PPS STORY Reflection Journal.<br><br>CCE(FTGP) lessons are supported by our MindsetMatters@PPS lessons to develop a growth mindset in our students and bolster student motivation in becoming lifelong learners.<br><br>

<span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:16px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.8">Student leaders engage students in a termly What’s Up Punggolites! News segment and students’ voice is heard during the accompanying Contemporary Issues Discussion (CID) lessons with Form Teachers.&nbsp;<br><br>
As all students are ambassadors to the school and play a pivotal role in displaying our STAR values, students are engaged in specific behaviours/actions to make values a lived experience for all.
