This programme is carried out by the CCE department members, teachers and pupils, who share stories, articles and experiences on our School Core values (Self-Discipline. Teamwork. Affection. Responsibility), National Education citizenship dispositions, Values-in-Action and The Growth Mindset. 

  

The department invites speakers from all walks of life to share their experiences and how they overcome their challenges. Pupils get a chance to interview and learn more from the lives of these inspiring people. 

  

The presenters use varied innovative strategies and resources to make their sharing more interesting and interactive for our students to internalise our school values, national values and community responsibility.
