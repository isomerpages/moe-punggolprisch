<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:16px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.8">This programme is carried out by the CCE department members, teachers and students, who share stories, articles and experiences on our School Core values (Self-Discipline. Teamwork. Affection. Responsibility), National Education citizenship dispositions, Values-in-Action and The Growth Mindset.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:16px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.8">The department invites speakers from all walks of life to share their experiences and how they overcome their challenges. Students get a chance to interview and learn more from the lives of these inspiring people.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:16px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.8">The presenters use varied innovative strategies and resources to make their sharing more interesting and interactive for our students to internalise our school values, national values and community responsibility.</p>
