<div style="font-family:Arial; font-size:16px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.8">The NE Team strives to deliver innovative and engaging activities that emphasise the objectives of the four NE Core Days; Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day. We encourage Student Voice and seek to develop the citizenship dispositions â€“ a sense of belonging, a sense of reality, a sense of hope and the will to action - amongst students by creating opportunities for student-led activities and sharing. We also focus on Strengthening the Singapore Story and nurturing Confident Speakers by giving students opportunities to reflect and share their views with the school.<br><br>
