<h4>National Education</h4>

The NE Team strives to deliver innovative and engaging activities that emphasise the objectives of the four NE Core Days; Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day. We encourage Student Voice and seek to develop the citizenship dispositions â€“ a sense of belonging, a sense of reality, a sense of hope and the will to action - amongst students by creating opportunities for student-led activities and sharing. We also focus on Strengthening the Singapore Story and nurturing Confident Speakers by giving pupils opportunities to reflect and share their views with the school.

  

Here are some photographs capturing our students during our NE Core days commemoration/celebrations.
