##### P3 Virtual LJ on SLS (Term 2/2021)
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:16px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.8">Primary 3 students from PPS joined their teachers on a virtual learning journey at the Gardens By The Bay. A team of Social Studies teachers recorded close-up views of the Supertrees, designed lessons that were integrated with science that portrayed Singapore’s sustainable efforts to conserve energy. What a better way to explain plant diversity and conservation at the Gardens By the Bay. The students’ wondrous illustrations of their super duper trees are captured as they went about navigating on SLS e-platform along with the physical copy of a customised LJ booklet.</p>
