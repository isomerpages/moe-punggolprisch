<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:16px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.8">The Termly Student Recognition Award recognises pupils who have role-modelled our school values by exemplifying observable character traits in their daily practices and who live up to our school vision of being ‘A Gracious Community of Confident and Innovative Life-Long Learners’. Form teachers of each level will use the character development rubric to nominate the model student of his/her class at the end of each term. These model students will then be featured prominently at our school’s CCE corner.</p>
