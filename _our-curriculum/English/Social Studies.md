<p>Social Studies include content knowledge that provides opportunities for
exploration into national identity, contemporary issues, as well as Singaporeâ€™s
constraints and vulnerabilities. As students interact with one another
through group activities, project work, and learning journeys, they learn
the skills of working together harmoniously, appreciating diversity, and
active listening. They also learn how to demonstrate STAR values as they
are encouraged to do their best in various learning tasks and relate to
their teachers and fellow classmates.</p>
