<center><i>CCAs are an integral part of our students’ holistic education. <br>Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents while<br>developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly 
changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together.<br>Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to<br>school, community and nation.</i></center>
