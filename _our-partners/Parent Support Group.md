			<p>Dear Fellow PPS Parents,</p><p><strong>Welcome to Punggol Primary School’s Parent Support Group website!</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Family plays a pivotal role in nurturing a child, offering encouragement and support as our little ones develop their independence to assimilate into society. This influence extends beyond just parents, as the dynamics of family in the current age have significantly broadened the definition of caregivers to include grandparents, extended family members, and, for some, reliable helpers. As the old saying goes, "it takes a village to raise a child," a sentiment that resonates with many of us.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">To that point, I’d like to extend a warm invitation to all parents and caregivers to volunteer with the PPS Parent Support Group (PSG). Your active participation in our vibrant community goes a long way to foster a collaborative environment between parents and teachers that will enhance each child's educational journey. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">For parents who have volunteered in past events, I’d like to say a big <b>"Thank you"</b>. For those who may be considering, I'd like to encourage you to join us. We eagerly anticipate partnering with each of you to make a difference in supporting and enriching the students' development at PPS. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">To quote Helen Keller, </p><blockquote style="font-size:20px; color:darkblue"><em>"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." </em></blockquote><p></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours sincerely,<br><br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Karen Lim Mei Lin<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;PSG Chairperson</b><br><br><br></p>
