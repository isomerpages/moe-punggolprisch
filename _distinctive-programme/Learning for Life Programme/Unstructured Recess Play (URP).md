**P1-P3 Unstructured Recess Play (URP)** 

  

<center>"In our schools, I think we can free up some space to embrace some messiness and<br>uncertainty of outcomes, as perfect structure and instructions can impede innovation. We can<br>afford this space to let our children’s imagination grow, because imagination is the wellspring<br>of ideas in their mental playground and will serve them richly for their journey through life."<br><br>Mr Ng Chee Meng, Minister of Education<br>(Schools)</center>
