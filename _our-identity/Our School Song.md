Here we are in Punggol Primary   
Always with a smile  
We’re bright and happy  
Kind and helpful  
We’re diligent too   
Come let us take pride   
Now and forever   
In whatever we do   
With courage and grace   
Bound by truth and love   
We strive for pride and glory   
Every waking hour   

Punggol Primary   
Let the people see   
We’ll be the very best that we can be   

Here we are in Punggol Primary   
Always standing tall   
We’ll stand together   
Grow together   
Helping one and all   

Come let us stay strong   
Now and forever   
In whatever we do   

With courage and grace   
bound by truth and love   
We strive for pride and glory   
Every waking hour   

Punggol Primary    
Let the people see   
We’ll be the very best that we can be   
We’ll be the very best that we can be
