The PPS STAR represents performance, excellence, and achievement. 

  

A freeform STAR is used to symbolise adaptability to changes. The form represents a human body leaping forward - showing a dynamic leap to meet societal changes. 

  

The HEART represents patience, love, and most of all, passion and determination - the cornerstones of pride. 

  

A portion of the heart edges out of the star to signify the passion to exceed expectations.
