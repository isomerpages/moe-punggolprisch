**Vision**   
A community of health-minded individuals who eat well and participate in regular physical activities.

  

**Mission**   
To instill passion and impart knowledge and skills that lead to healthy living.

  

**Objective**   
Our CCAâ€™s objective is to help selected students improve their health which reduces their risk of health diseases in the future. We guide our members in making lifestyle modifications involving nutrition and physical activities. We believe strongly in the joy of staying healthy and active. With activities such as healthy food-making, hikes at parks, and collaboration with partners such as Health Promotion Board (Active Youth Workout) and National Kidney Foundation (CHAMPS Programme), we enrich our members while inspiring them to improve their health.
