##### Brief Description of CCA

In addition to building up each child in his/her own physical capacity and competence in skills (dribbling, shooting, passing) and abilities, opportunities to learn to work with others (playing as a team in competitions) to develop social awareness, relationship management skills are key fundamentals in laying a bright foundation for the future.
