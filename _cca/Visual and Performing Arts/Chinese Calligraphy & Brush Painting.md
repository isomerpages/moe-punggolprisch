##### Brief Description of CCA

Pupils learn basic painting techniques in their weekly lessons. When they become more skillful, they would be invited to work together to create larger paintings to showcase what they have learnt. In 2019, one of their paintings received a Certificate of Recognition (Special Mention) in SYF. The painting, Harmony, was exhibited at National Museum Singapore and Academy of Singapore Teachers. It was also featured on SYFâ€™s online platform and catalogue.
