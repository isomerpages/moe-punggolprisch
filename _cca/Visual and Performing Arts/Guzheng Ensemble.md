##### Vision
A graceful community of performers with passion in oriental music  

##### Mission
Cultivating confident performers and passion in oriental music  

##### Objective
We seek to develop the students into confident performers with passion in oriental music and equipping them with the confidence and grace in performance.

##### Brief Description of CCA
Punggol Primary School Guzheng Ensemble seeks to equip the students with the basic skills of reading the Chinese sheet music and progressing to different plucking techniques. We hope to imbue in them the confidence to perform solo, for DSA-Sec selection and in a group setting, in a concert. Students will be trained the basic sight-reading skills under the guidance of our instructors in the Junior Group. Upon promotion to the Senior Group, the students will be taught skills to perform to a larger audience. The performances help to build confidence and teamwork in the students as they play in harmony.
