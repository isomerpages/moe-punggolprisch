##### Vision

Every member a creative problem solver  
  

##### Mission

To explore and extend interests in robotics and provide a common space for friendships and social integration

  

##### Objective

Our goal is to equip the pupils with computational and problem-solving skills through meaningful interaction. Through weekly training, pupils will learn the importance of teamwork and effective communication and develop into a confident leader.

  

##### Brief Description of CCA

Pupils will learn the basics of EV3 LEGO mindstorm robots. They will be tasked to build and programme the robots to complete missions design by our trainers. Through the mission, they will learn to work effectively as a team and apply what they learned to solve the problems creatively.
