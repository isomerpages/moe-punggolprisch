<h4>Vision</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">To nurture every English Debate &amp; Drama Club member into a confident and creative member, who is able to express himself/herself articulately in the realm of oratory and dramatisation via the use of the English Language.</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">To expose members to different forms of dramatisation and oratorical skills and ignite a passion and love for theatre arts, argumentation and public speaking.</p>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">The goal of the English Debate &amp; Drama Club is to nurture and develop pupils’ talents and skills in the area of public speaking through drama and debate activities.</p>
<h4>Brief Description of CCA</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">In Debate, all members go through training on how to formulate and present arguments in response to assigned motions. Members will have opportunities to research for information and craft their speeches in a structured and persuasive manner. Debate practice sessions and competitions help our members to hone their skills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In Drama, members are taught the core basics of dramatic technique – vocal projection, awareness of body language, facial expressions and use of space. Members get the opportunity to display what they have learnt through various school-based performances and competitions. Members are also exposed to a myriad of experiences such as script-writing and stage craft which includes making props or designing costumes.</p>
