<center><b><u>CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES</u></b></center>

<center><i>CCAs are an integral part of our students’ holistic education. <br>Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents while<br>developing values and competencies that will prepare them <br>for a rapidly changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among students <br>from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. <br>Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens students’ <br>sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to<br>school, community and nation.</i></center>

In PPS, we offer students CCAs from the following options:

*   [Clubs and Societies](/cca/Clubs-and-Societies/design-and-innovation-club/)
*   [Physical Sports](/cca/Physical-Sports/basketball/)
*   [Uniformed Groups](/cca/Uniformed-Groups/boys-brigade/)
*   [Visual and Performing Arts Group](/cca/Visual-and-Performing-Arts/arts-n-craft-club/)


At the primary level, it is not compulsory for students to participate in school-based CCA. However, we strongly encourage all pupils to participate in at least 1 school-based CCA during their course of study in PPS.
