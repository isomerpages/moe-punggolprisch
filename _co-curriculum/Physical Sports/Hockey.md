##### Vision

The Sport for all, The Sport for Excellence  
  

##### Mission

Nurturing a community of champions, in deed and character

  

##### Objective

The Hockey CCA strives to equip players with the skills and experience required for recreational and competitive hockey. We achieve this through regular training sessions, participation in external competitions and annual camps.

  

##### Brief Description of CCA

Hockey is our schoolâ€™s niche sport based on its success in the National Senior and Junior Championships. We have consistently developed athletes who display strong values in sports i.e. sportsmanship and possess strong physical skills. Many of our hockey players continue to pursue hockey beyond their primary school years. Here in hockey, we share sweat and tears, but most importantly, we share memories that last a lifetime.
