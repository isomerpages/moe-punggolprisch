<h4>Vision</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">A joyful and confident community of learners that are passionate about singing and performing.</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">To cultivate in pupils a life-long interest and an appreciation in the arts.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">We aim to develop students’ potential in singing and performing skills as well as to promote an appreciation for singing. Choir also focuses on character building as well as leadership training.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Choir plays a major role in various school events, frequently staging performances in school’s celebrations such as yearly prize-giving ceremony. Our pupils also participate in external competitions and performance events. Besides weekly practices, our pupils attend workshops and exchange programmes to constantly improve and better equip themselves in their singing and vocal techniques.</p>
