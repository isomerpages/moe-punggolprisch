**Cheng San Library Art Exhibition**

Budding artists from Punggol Primary School got a special highlight when their artworks got exhibited at the Cheng San Public Library from 12 March to 24 March 2018, through a special collaboration between the school and the National Library Board.&nbsp; Visitors to the library were treated to a visual feast, ranging from metal tooling crafts, acrylic painting, still life drawings, Chinese brush paintings and ceramic sculptures done by pupils across the six levels. It was indeed a proud moment for these young artists, to see the public appreciating and admiring their artworks and taking pictures of the exhibits on display.
